        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey Dana, it's been a long time since I've had the chance to get through to you, so if you're reading this I'm really happy.
         I'll start by talking about how things have been on my end to keep you updated, although I'll keep this short because this is not
          what the site is about. I've passed 11/12 exams thankfully, so passing the year was a success. Thank you for being with me through
          most of the year, especially this winter when I was at my lowest and I was so uncertain if I can pass the year with the way 
          I started. Even though in some of our dicussions we weren't exactly on the same page I always appreciated your input and I knew that
          you tried to make me feel better in your way and helped me see that it's not the end of the world even if I fail. Although failing for
          me meant more than just an ego hit, it also felt like moving a step further from you. I'm pretty sure I told you already, but before
          I met you I never thought about studying abroad, but as we grew closer I admired the way you always talked about your plans of moving in
          the UK and studying there and I wanted to do the same, or at least something similar, that way I believed I would be closer to make the
          most out of my potential. 
        </p>
        <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now here I am moving into the second year of my computer science degree in Delft making a site for you, even using some 
          stuff I learned in class, so I'm grateful for you, although I'm not even sure you realise how much you helped me in this regard. Now 
          that I've talked about this, I want to talk more about us. You see, this relationship we had was in no way an easy relationship, but I
          don't regret for a single second meeting you or anything I've ever done for you. I feel like in this relationship you gave me motivation,
          you helped me, educated me on different subjects when I was unaware and overall you helped me grow as a person, and I hope it was the same way
          for you as it was for me. I still remember when we were still in our first year of the relationship and you told me "I hope you'll be looking
          back at this relationship and look back at it in a positive way", now I can safely say I will always look back on our relationship in a positive light because
          you've given me so much I could never see it any other way. It's true that a lot of stuff happend between us, a lot of it was my fault
          and I hope you know how bad I feel about it and that I regret things I can never take back. Still, I hope you can also see our time 
          together as something positive the way I see it. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I miss you so much and it's horrible writing this because it makes everything feel so much
          more real, but I wanted you to see all of this, since everything between us stopped so suddenly without having a chance to talk about things 
          properly. I feel horrible knowing that our last conversation
          might be the last time you blocked me, with that argument we had that I was stupid enough to handle the way I did. I'm sorry that I was
          so insensitive in that conversation, because I still remember how insensitive I was and that I didn't think about your feelings and I was
          only focused on mine. Your pain is something I should have always been able to comfort and take it as it was my own. I'll be leaving for uni 
          on the 6th of September, I hope that until then we can meet to talk about what happend, and in general, just to talk.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you decide that
          we can meet before then, you can tell me on this website in the chat page that you'll see up on the header of the page. What you'll find
          there is basically a private chat like WhatsApp, but made by me this time. I'll always be there for you no matter what you are going 
          through, you can always call me and I'll be there. Eventually get a plane ticket if shits bad. When I was with you I always felt like
          I was home and something was right. Sometimes I'm thinking maybe I didn't thank you enough for the love you showed me at times, like
          the time when we were in Southampton watching Big Hero 6 and at some point you started crying telling me that I can't die. That's one of 
          the few moments in my life I felt so loved and needed by someone. I thought about it so many times since it happend and everytime it
          just made me think how grateful I was that you were in my life for so long, and wishing that you still were. I have so many more things
          I want to tell you and I hope we can meet before I leave so I can tell you everything that's difficult for me to put into words right now
          in front of a screen. Pup.
